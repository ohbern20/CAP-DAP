Both of these datasets are comprised of data I collected in my summer 2022 research project 

Regen_data_summer_22_metadata:

Name: Who collected the data

Date: The date the data were collected

Forest: The forest where the data were collected

Plot_num: The plot number (1-3) where the data were collected

Plot_lat: The latitude of the center of the plot

Plot_long: The longitude of the center of the plot

Percent_clouds: The percent of clouds in the sky, determined by looking at sky and approximating

Regen_species: The species of the regen (seedling or sapling) in the plot

Regen_type: Whether that individual species of regen is a seedling (<1m in height) or sapling (DBH > 1m)

Regen_count: The number of regen for each species and type found in the plot

Site_description: General description of the plot - prominent tree species, weather, etc. 


Ground_cover_canopy_density_summer22_metadata:

Name: Who collected the data

Date: The date the data were collected

Forest: The forest where the data were collected

Plot_num: The plot number (1-3) where the data were collected

Plot_lat: The latitude of the center of the plot

Percent_bare: The percent of bare ground in the ground cover plot

Percent_nonvascular: The percent of nonvascular plants in the ground cover plot

Percent_ferns: The percent of ferns in the ground cover plot

Percent_angiosperms: The percent of angiosperms in the ground cover plot

Regen_densiometer: The canopy density above the regen plot measured with a densiometer facing N

Regen_canopyapp: The canopy density above the regen plot measured with CanopyApp facing N

Density_quadrant: The quadrant for each density reading (not associated with density readings above region plot) 

Densiomer: The density reading for a specific quadrant using the densiometer, taken facing N
